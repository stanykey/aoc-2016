# [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016)

I've done that year's (2016) challenges for fun and to refresh memory about some of the basic algorithms and approaches
without deep performance optimization since I prefer idiomatic and readable code until it really needs to be much
faster, so most of the solutions are quick enough to do a job in seconds under default CPython.

Also, I was a bit inspired by already existing Python and other languages runner frameworks, so I decided to try to
implement my mini framework for downloading inputs and submitting answers and maybe something more, but it's just an
idea, so I don't have a clue how it will look at the end at all, so we'll see what comes of this :)

### Rules:

- `Python 3.12`
- `Built-in only` for puzzle solutions
- `PEP8`
- `Type hinting`
- Linters ([Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) and [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/index.html))
